# 🔥 (#79) Reactive CSS

September 2022

## 🔥 Reactive CSS

In Vue 3 we can use reactive values in our `<style>` block just like we can in the `<template>` block:

```html
<style scoped>
  .button {
    color: v-bind(buttonColor);
  }
</style>
```

Behind the scenes, Vue uses CSS computed properties (aka CSS variables) scoped to each component.

The CSS remains static, but we can dynamically update the CSS variables whenever the reactive value changes.

More info can be found [in the docs](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-css-features.html#v-bind-in-css).

## 🔥 What are all these loops for?

I always forget this, so this tip is mostly for me — hopefully, I won't have to keep looking this up!

We have 3 types of `for` loops in Javascript:

1. `for...in`
2. `for...of`
3. `for`

But how do you know which one to use?

For iterating through **properties** of an object, use `for...in`:

```javascript
const numbers = {
  one: 1,
  two: 2,
  three: 3,
};

// We get the properties of the object, not the values
for (const number in numbers) {
  console.log(number);
}

// Prints: 'one' 'two' 'three'
```

Items in a **list** (also called an iterable object) like an Array or Set, we use `for...of`:

```javascript
const numbers = ["one", "two", "three"];

// We get each of the elements in the Array
for (const number of numbers) {
  console.log(number);
}

// Prints: 'one' 'two' 'three'
```

You _can_ use `for...in` with an Array since all the indices are just the object's properties. But you may not get them in the correct order, and you'll also get any other properties the Array has :/

And you know how to use a regular old `for` loop, which lets you have a lot more control with some extra typing.

## 📜 Vue.js Performance Guide

MadeWithVueJS has put together a great performance guide for Vue.js.

It doesn't cover _how_ to do everything, but offers a detailed checklist of things you should be considering for your application.

The guide also includes tons of resources and tools to go deeper into performance optimization.

Read it here: [Vue.js Performance Guide](https://madewithvuejs.com/blog/vuejs-performance-guide)

## 🧠 Spaced-repetition: Configurable Composables

**The best way to commit something to long-term memory is to periodically review it, gradually increasing the time between reviews 👨‍🔬**

**Actually remembering these tips is much more useful than just a quick distraction, so here's a tip from a couple weeks ago to jog your memory.**

The key to highly reusable composables is making them configurable.

To do this we can pass in an options object as the last parameter of the composable:

```javascript
const count = useCount(4, { incrementBy: 2 });
```

This way, we can use the composable in it’s default configuration:

```javascript
const count = useCount(4);
```

While still being able to access the custom behaviour if we need it.

This is how we might implement this in a composable:

```javascript
export function useCount(count, opts) {
  const { incrementBy } = opts;
  // ...
}
```

We take our options object and destructure any values that we need out of it.

Because we are using an object for this configuration, it’s very easy to add in additional properties in the future:

```javascript
export function useCount(count, opts) {
  const { incrementBy, decrementBy } = opts;
  // ...
}
```

And because we don’t have to worry about the order of parameters when things are inside an object, we don’t break existing code!
