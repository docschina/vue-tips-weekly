# 🔥 (#80) Component Metadata

September 2022

Hey!

This week I started recording the first batch of Mastering Nuxt 3 videos.

It's been awhile since I did lots of screencasting, so it's taking some time to find my rhythm again, but so far so good!

Enjoy these tips, and have a great week!

## 🔥 Don't Override Component CSS

It can be really tempting to quickly modify a component's CSS from outside the component. If all you need is a slight modification, it seems harmless — but it's not.

Let's say you have a normally blue button, but you need it to be green in this specific case. You can override the background colour from the parent component like this:

```html
<template>
  <button class="green">Make this button green</button>
</template>

<style>
  .green.button {
    background: green;
  }
</style>
```

This _does_ work, but it's very fragile and prone to breaking.

What if the class name changes?

What if the HTML of the component is modified?

Anyone making changes to the button component will have no idea that this component's background colour is overridden. They won't know to update this component too.

Instead, we can just extend the functionality of the button component. That way, we keep all of the code that modifies the button inside the button component.

Here, we can add a `is-green` prop to the button component:

```html
<template>
  <button is-green>Make this button green</button>
</template>

<style>
  /* No extra styles needed! */
</style>
```

Adding to the component itself makes it easier for anyone else who might need this button to be green in the future!

I've created a demo showing the original component and the new one with the added prop: [https://codesandbox.io/s/wizardly-aryabhata-kn37d?file=/src/components/Button.vue](https://codesandbox.io/s/wizardly-aryabhata-kn37d?file=/src/components/Button.vue)

## 🔥 Component Metadata

Not every bit of info you add to a component is state. For example, sometimes, you need to add metadata that gives _other_ components more information.

For example, if you want this layout to know how many columns each widget should take up, you can add that directly on the component as metadata:

```javascript
export default {
  name: "LiveUsersWidget",
  // Just add it as an extra property
  columns: 3,
  props: {
    // ...
  },
  data() {
    return {
      //...
    };
  },
};
```

You'll find this metadata as a property on the component:

```javascript
import LiveUsersWidget from "./LiveUsersWidget.vue";
const { columns } = LiveUsersWidget;
```

You can also access the metadata from within the component through the special `$options` property:

```javascript
export default {
  name: "LiveUsersWidget",
  columns: 3,
  created() {
    // `$options` contains all the metadata for a component
    console.log(`Using ${this.$options.metadata} columns`);
  },
};
```

Just keep in mind that this metadata is the same for each component instance and is _not_ reactive.

Other uses for this include (but are not limited to):

- Keeping version numbers for individual components
- Custom flags for build tools to treat components differently
- Adding custom features to components beyond computed props, data, watchers, etc.
- and many more I can't think of!

## 📜 Coding Better Composables: Options Object (1/5)

I teamed up with Vue Mastery to create this series on coding better composables.

In this series we cover five different patterns.

For each, we show how you can implement it and then we see it in action with a composable from VueUse.

This first article is on using an options object to easily configure the behaviour of your composable.

## 💬 Data structures

"Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships." —Linus Torvalds

## 🧠 Spaced-repetition: Async Without Await

**The best way to commit something to long-term memory is to periodically review it, gradually increasing the time between reviews 👨‍🔬**

**Actually remembering these tips is much more useful than just a quick distraction, so here's a tip from a couple weeks ago to jog your memory.**

Using async logic with the composition API can be tricky at times.

We need to put things in the correct order, or the `await` keyword will mess things up with our reactivity.

But with the Async Without Await pattern, we don’t need to worry about all of this:

```javascript
const title = ref("Basic Title");
// We can place this async function wherever we want
const { state } = useAsyncState(fetchData());
const betterTitle = computed(() => `${title.value}!`);
```

Here’s how this works:

1. We hook up all of our refs _synchronously_
2. Updates happen _asynchronously_ in the background
3. Because of reactivity, everything “just works”

Here’s a basic sketch of what the `useAsyncState` composable from VueUse is doing to implement this:

```javascript
export default useAsyncState(promise) {
  // 1. Create state ref synchronously
  const state = ref(null);

  const execute = async () => {
    // 3. Reactivity will update this when it resolves
    state.value = await promise;
  }

  // 2. Execute promise asynchronously in the background
  execute();
  return state;
}
```

_p.s. I also have three courses: [Vue Tips Collection](https://michaelnthiessen.com/vue-tips-collection), [Reusable Components](https://michaelnthiessen.com/reusable-components) and [Clean Components](https://michaelnthiessen.com/clean-components)_
