天哪，虽然已经持续发布了 71 周的周刊，我今天差点忘了！

新周刊发了，虽迟但到！

这是本周的 tips 内容！

## 🔥 The CSS Unselector

提起 CSS 我们通常讨论的是如何通过选择器来选择具体元素。

Part of this process is making sure the selector does not select the wrong elements. This is often the hardest part!

要确保选对了元素，这很难。

My blog uses Vue Router, which applies the class .router-link-active to any link that links to the current route (the page we’re on right now). I then use this class to change the colour of the current link, to help the user know where they’re at.

我的博客使用了 Vue Router 提供的 `.router-link-active` 来让链接当前的页面。我会改变当前链接的颜色，让用户知道我们在哪。

But I wanted to make sure that all links within the page do not get highlighted in the same way.

For example, a table of contents at the beginning of an article should have normal looking links, not the changed colour.

To do this I needed to avoid selecting all of the links with a # in the href attribute:

```
.router-link-active:not([href*='#'])
```

I’m using a :not query, but then using an attribute selector inside of that.

My actual code is even more fun, because there are a few other things going on that I need to account for:

```
.nav-link.router-link-exact-active:not(.site-title):not([href*='#'])
```

## 🔥 Dynamic Returns

A composable can either return a single value or an object of values. Typically, these values are refs.

But we can also dynamically switch between the two depending on what we want to use the composable for:

```js
// Grab only the single value
const now = useNow();

// Get more granular access to the composable
const { now, pause, resume } = useNow({ controls: true });
```

This is great because we may only need a single value most of the time. So why complicate the interface for the main use case?

But by dynamically providing the full object of refs, we allow for more advanced use cases as well. Even if they are rarely used.

Here is how we might implement that:

```js
export default useNow(opts) {
const {
  controls = false,
} = opts;

  // Do some things in your composable

  if (controls) {
    return { now, pause, resume };
  } else {
    return now;
  }
}
```

## 📜 Invalidating Computed Props

How do you force a computed prop to update? And why would you ever find yourself in that situation to begin with?

In this article, Abdelrahman shows us a really clever solution to this very interesting problem he encountered with computed props.

## 💬 Theory and Practice

"Theory is when you know something, but it doesn’t work. Practice is when something works, but you don’t know why. Programmers combine theory and practice: Nothing works and they don’t know why." — Unknown

## 🧠 Spaced-repetition: Why there must be one source of truth

**想要长时间牢牢记住某些事情，最好方式就是定期回顾，逐渐增加回顾的间隔 👨‍🔬**

**实际上，记住这些 tips 比发呆有用得多，这是几周前的一个 tip 可以唤起你的记忆。**

This is the most critical principle of state management that I know:

Each piece of state has a single owner, a single source of truth.

No one else is allowed to modify the state. It's just borrowed temporarily.

If you have an array in a Vuex store, only that Vuex store can update it. Anywhere in your app that needs that value must get it from the store (directly or through another component).

If the state is owned by a component, only that component can modify it. This means other components must emit an event to that component, which can then decide what it wants to do.

Why?

If you allow state to be modified from anywhere, your code becomes a tangled mess.

With a single source of truth, you can easily understand what's happening.

The best code is easily understood.
