<insert>## 🔥 Async Without Await

Using async logic with the composition API can be tricky at times.

We need to put things in the correct order, or the `await` keyword will mess things up with our reactivity.

But with the Async Without Await pattern, we don’t need to worry about all of this:

```javascript
const title = ref("Basic Title");
// We can place this async function wherever we want
const { state } = useAsyncState(fetchData());
const betterTitle = computed(() => `${title.value}!`);
```

Here’s how this works:

1. We hook up all of our refs _synchronously_
2. Updates happen _asynchronously_ in the background
3. Because of reactivity, everything “just works”

Here’s a basic sketch of what the `useAsyncState` composable from VueUse is doing to implement this:

```javascript
export default useAsyncState(promise) {
	// 1. Create state ref synchronously
  const state = ref(null);

  const execute = async () => {
		// 3. Reactivity will update this when it resolves
    state.value = await promise;
  }

	// 2. Execute promise asynchronously in the background
  execute();
	return state;
}
```

## 🔥 Nested CSS

Nesting in CSS isn’t yet available in most browsers, but we can still do it using a pre-processor like PostCSS:

```css
/* Get rid of link highlighting in article headings */
.content {
  h1,
  h2,
  h3,
  h4,
  h5,
  h6 {
    a {
      @apply text-type-dark;
    }
  }
}
```

Here I wanted to override the link styles for all the headings on my blog, and nesting came in extremely handy!

Without nesting, I would have had to specify this property for each heading level individually, and it would have been a mess. Especially since I only wanted to target the headings that are part of the content, not site-wide headings:

```css
.content h1 a {
  @apply text-type-dark;
}

.content h2 a {
  @apply text-type-dark;
}

.content h3 a {
  @apply text-type-dark;
}

// ...you get the idea
```

Of course, until browsers get around to implementing this natively, this is exactly what this nested CSS compiles to. It’s like expanding the equation `2(a + b)` into `2a + 2b`.

But the key is that you don’t have to write it this way!

With PostCSS you can use the [postcss-nesting](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/tree/main/plugins/postcss-nesting) plugin to make this happen.

If you’re using Nuxt 3 with TailwindCSS like I am, the [Nuxt Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.nuxtjs.org/) module comes with this enabled by default!

## 💬 Less Documentation

"The best reaction to "this is confusing, where are the docs" is to rewrite the feature to make it less confusing, not write more docs." —Jeff Atwood

## 🧠 Spaced-repetition:

**The best way to commit something to long-term memory is to periodically review it, gradually increasing the time between reviews 👨‍🔬**

**Actually remembering these tips is much more useful than just a quick distraction, so here's a tip from a couple weeks ago to jog your memory.**

_p.s. I also have two courses: [Reusable Components](https://michaelnthiessen.com/reusable-components) and [Clean Components](https://michaelnthiessen.com/clean-components)_</insert>
