Announcing...

🎉 **Vue Tips Collection** 🎉

A collection of 100+ concise and practical tips on Vue, packaged into a stunning book.

It will be available on **June 20th!**

(that's only _2.5 weeks_ from now!)

I've been working hard on this one for a long time, and put my heart and soul into it.

...and now we'll return to our regularly scheduled tips.

## 🔥 Structuring Composables

To keep your composables — those extracted functions written using the composition API — neat and easy to read, here's a way to organize the code.

1. Component and directives
2. `provide` and `inject`
3. `defineProps`, `defineEmits`, and `defineExpose` (when using `script setup`)
4. `refs` and `reactive` variables
5. Computed properties
6. Immediate watchers
7. Watchers
8. Lifecycle methods, in [their correct order](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-lifecycle-hooks.html)
9. Non-reactive state
10. Methods
11. Async code using `await` (or Promises if you're into that sort of thing)

Why this order? Because it more or less follows the order of execution of the code.

It's also based on the [Vue 3 styleguide](https://v3.vuejs.org/style-guide/#component-instance-options-order-recommended).

The `await` needs to go at the end because most of your logic you'll want to be registered before the `setup` function returns. Anything after the `await` will only be executed asynchronously.

## 🔥 Reactive CSS

In Vue 3 we can use reactive values in our `<style>` block just like we can in the `<template>` block:

```html
<style scoped>
  .button {
    color: v-bind(buttonColor);
  }
</style>
```

Behind the scenes, Vue uses CSS computed properties (aka CSS variables) scoped to each component.

The CSS remains static, but we can dynamically update the CSS variables whenever the reactive value changes.

More info can be found [in the docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-style.html#state-driven-dynamic-css).

## 📜 Mark Raw Optimization

This article takes a deeper look at VueUse's `useManualRefHistory`, and how we can optimize our non-reactive state when it gets large.

## 🧠 Spaced-repetition: Directives in Render Functions

**The best way to commit something to long-term memory is to periodically review it, gradually increasing the time between reviews 👨‍🔬**

**Actually remembering these tips is much more useful than just a quick distraction, so here's a tip from a couple weeks ago to jog your memory.**

Vue comes with some methods to help you use custom directives on your VNodes:

```html
<script setup>
  import { resolveDirective, withDirectives, h } from "vue";

  // Find the already registered directive by name
  const focusDirective = resolveDirective("focus");

  // Wrap the button with the directive
  const render = () =>
    withDirectives(
      h("button", {}, []),
      // An array of directives to apply
      [[focusDirective]]
    );
</script>
```

You can find more info on using `withDirectives` [on the docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/global-api.html#withdirectives).

_p.s. I also have two courses: [Reusable Components](https://michaelnthiessen.com/reusable-components) and [Clean Components](https://michaelnthiessen.com/clean-components)_
