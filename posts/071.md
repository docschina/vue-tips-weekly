# 🔥 (#71) Great Developers

July 2022

Hey there,

I heard you were looking for some tips on Vue.

—Michael

## 🔥 Directly accessing parent components (and why)

Props down, events up. That's how your components should communicate — most of the time.

But in _rare cases_, that just doesn't work.

If you need direct access to the parent component, you can use the instance property `$parent`:

```javascript
// Tight coupling like this is usually a bad idea
this.$parent.methodOnParentComponent();
```

You can also get direct access to the application root, the very top-most component in the tree, by using `$root`. Vue 2 also has `$children`, but it was taken out for Vue 3 (please don't use this one).

**When would these be useful?**

There are a few different scenarios I can think of. Usually, when you want to abstract some behaviour and have it work "magically" behind the scenes.

You don't want to use props and events to connect up a component in those cases. Instead, you use `provide`/`inject`, `$parent`, or `$root`, to _automatically_ connect the components and make things happen.

But it's hard to come up with an example where this is the best solution. Using `provide`/`inject` is almost always the better choice.

## 🔥 Blockquotes

This element is used for quotes outside of the main flow of an article.

> Like this quote. Most browsers will indent this automatically, and most websites will add extra styling.

While you can use a `div` with some CSS, the `<blockquote>` element is the semantically correct way of doing this.

In Markdown, you can use `>` to get a blockquote.

## 📜 Ignorable Watch

This article is a great look at how you can use the `flush` option with watchers to create some pretty complex and useful behaviours.

I don't want to spoil it for you though. Just read the article!

## 💬 Great Developers

"Every great developer you know got there by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it." —Patrick McKenzie

## 🧠 Spaced-repetition: Special CSS pseudo-selectors in Vue

**The best way to commit something to long-term memory is to periodically review it, gradually increasing the time between reviews 👨‍🔬**

**Actually remembering these tips is much more useful than just a quick distraction, so here's a tip from a couple weeks ago to jog your memory.**

If you want some styles to apply specifically to slot content, you can do that with the `:slotted` pseudo-selector:

```html
<style scoped>
  /* Add margin to <p> tags within the slot */
  :slotted(p) {
    margin: 15px 5px;
  }
</style>
```

You can also use `:global` to have styles apply to global scope, even within the `<style scoped>` block:

```html
<style scoped>
  :global(body) {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    font-family: sans-serif;
  }
</style>
```

Of course, if you have lots of global styles you want to add, it's probably easier to just add a second `<style>` block:

```html
<style scoped>
  /* Add margin to <p> tags within the slot */
  :slotted(p) {
    margin: 15px 5px;
  }
</style>

<style>
  body {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    font-family: sans-serif;
  }
</style>
```

Check out [the docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-style.html#slotted-selectors) for more info.

_p.s. I also have two courses: [Reusable Components](https://michaelnthiessen.com/reusable-components) and [Clean Components](https://michaelnthiessen.com/clean-components)_
